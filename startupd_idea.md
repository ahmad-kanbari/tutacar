Development Timeline & Budget Estimate
Team Needed:

1 Full-stack developer (or 1 mobile + 1 backend developer)
1 UI/UX designer (can be freelance)
1 Project manager (you can do this initially)

Timeline:

Design & Planning: 3 weeks
MVP Development: 10-12 weeks
Testing & Launch: 2 weeks
Total: 4 months to launch

Rough Budget (outsourcing to freelancers):

Development: $15,000 - $30,000
Design: $3,000 - $5,000
Infrastructure (first year): $2,000
Marketing (first 3 months): $5,000
Total: ~$25,000 - $42,000 for MVP

(If you code yourself or find co-founders, costs drop significantly)

Critical Success Factors

Trust Building: Verify every mechanic, showcase real reviews
Fast Onboarding: Mechanics should sign up in under 10 minutes
Reliability: If a driver books, mechanic must show up (enforce with ratings/penalties)
Education Over Sales: Focus on helping drivers, not just transactions
Local First: Master one city before expanding


Next Steps for You

Validate demand: Interview 20 drivers and 10 mechanics in your area
Sketch wireframes: Use Figma (free) to visualize the apps
Find co-founders: Look for a technical co-founder if you're non-technical
Legal setup: Register business, check local regulations for service platforms
Build landing page: Collect emails from interested drivers/mechanics pre-launch


This is 100% feasible with a small team and can create real impact by reducing driver anxiety around car problems while giving mechanics more consistent business. The key is starting focused (one city, core features) and iterating based on real user feedback.
